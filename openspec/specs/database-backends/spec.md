# database-backends Specification

## Purpose

Define supported database backend wiring so local, Helm, SQLite, and external PostgreSQL deployments behave consistently.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Helm external PostgreSQL wiring resolves a non-empty database URL

When the Helm chart deploys with `postgresql.enabled=false`, it MUST provide a non-empty `CODEX_LB_DATABASE_URL` to the workload from one of the supported external database inputs. The chart MUST accept a direct `externalDatabase.url`, and it MUST also support reading `database-url` from an operator-provided external database secret reference without requiring the application encryption-key secret to be the same object.

#### Scenario: Direct external database URL is used

- **WHEN** `postgresql.enabled=false`
- **AND** `externalDatabase.url` is non-empty
- **THEN** the rendered workload uses that value for `CODEX_LB_DATABASE_URL`

#### Scenario: External database URL comes from a dedicated secret reference

- **WHEN** `postgresql.enabled=false`
- **AND** `externalDatabase.existingSecret` is set
- **THEN** the rendered workload reads `database-url` from that secret for `CODEX_LB_DATABASE_URL`

### Requirement: PostgreSQL engines validate and recycle pooled connections

When `database_url` resolves to a PostgreSQL backend, the application MUST configure each async engine -- both the request-path `engine` and the optional background-task `_background_engine` -- with `pool_pre_ping=True` and a finite `pool_recycle` window. This is required so the application detects connections that the PostgreSQL server has silently closed (idle timeout, restart, network reset) before the first real query is dispatched on them, and so connections are cycled before they reach any reasonable upstream keep-alive boundary.

#### Scenario: Stale connections are rejected before checkout

- **WHEN** a pooled connection has been closed by the server while sitting idle
- **AND** that connection is the next one a session tries to use
- **THEN** SQLAlchemy issues a pre-ping (`SELECT 1`), detects the dead connection, and transparently replaces it
- **AND** the application returns `200` (or the real business-level result), not `500 server_error` with `asyncpg.InterfaceError: connection is closed`

#### Scenario: Pool recycle bounds connection age

- **WHEN** a pooled connection has been open longer than `database_pool_recycle_seconds`
- **AND** that connection is the next one a session tries to use
- **THEN** SQLAlchemy discards and replaces the connection before the next query
- **AND** the default `database_pool_recycle_seconds` is `1800` seconds

#### Scenario: SQLite backends are not affected

- **WHEN** `database_url` resolves to a SQLite backend (file or `:memory:`)
- **THEN** neither `pool_pre_ping` nor `pool_recycle` is configured on the engine
- **AND** existing SQLite-specific tuning (PRAGMAs, `busy_timeout`) is unchanged

### Requirement: Database pool controls cover request-adjacent background sessions

The service SHALL expose database pool settings for both the main request pool
and the background/request-adjacent session pool. The background pool SHALL
default to the main pool size and overflow settings, and operators MAY override
the background pool size and overflow separately.

#### Scenario: Background pool inherits main pool capacity

- **WHEN** `database_background_pool_size` and `database_background_max_overflow` are unset
- **THEN** the background/request-adjacent DB pool uses `database_pool_size` and `database_max_overflow`

#### Scenario: Background pool has explicit lower capacity

- **WHEN** `database_background_pool_size` and `database_background_max_overflow` are configured
- **THEN** the background/request-adjacent DB pool uses those explicit values

### Requirement: SQLite live profile controls write contention

When `codex-lb` is configured to use SQLite for live serving, official behavior and guidance MUST treat SQLite as a single-writer backend and MUST provide a supported operating profile that limits concurrent write contention without requiring PostgreSQL.

#### Scenario: SQLite live profile is conservative by default

- **WHEN** an operator chooses SQLite for live Docker or long-running local serving
- **THEN** the supported SQLite profile limits runtime write concurrency through a single request worker, a single writer, or an equivalent serialization mechanism
- **AND** the profile preserves the existing SQLite database URL format

#### Scenario: Multi-worker SQLite requires explicit write hardening

- **WHEN** SQLite is used with more than one request worker
- **THEN** write-hot paths serialize writes or apply bounded lock retry/backoff before returning a server error
- **AND** the runtime does not rely on SQLite busy timeout alone as the only mitigation for expected concurrent writer overlap

### Requirement: SQLite lock pressure is retried on write-hot paths

Write-hot SQLite operations that are part of request admission, usage reservation, bridge ownership, or liveness bookkeeping MUST handle transient SQLite lock errors with bounded retry/backoff before returning a 5xx response.

#### Scenario: Usage reservation write hits a transient SQLite lock

- **WHEN** a usage reservation insert or update fails because SQLite reports the database is locked
- **THEN** the operation is retried with bounded backoff while the request budget remains available
- **AND** the final failure, if any, is logged with enough context to distinguish lock exhaustion from non-retryable database errors

#### Scenario: Bridge liveness write hits a transient SQLite lock

- **WHEN** a bridge or ring heartbeat write fails because SQLite reports the database is locked
- **THEN** the liveness write is retried with bounded backoff or deferred through the configured SQLite write-serialization path
- **AND** transient lock pressure does not immediately mark healthy bridge workers as failed

### Requirement: Higher-concurrency deployments recommend PostgreSQL

`codex-lb` MUST preserve SQLite as the default backend for zero-config and simple local startup, and it MUST document PostgreSQL as the recommended backend for deployments that expect higher concurrency, write-heavy traffic, or sustained multi-worker serving.

#### Scenario: Zero-config startup keeps SQLite as the default

- **WHEN** an operator starts `codex-lb` without setting `CODEX_LB_DATABASE_URL`
- **THEN** the runtime uses the default SQLite-backed database path
- **AND** official guidance presents SQLite as the convenience default for simple local startup

#### Scenario: Higher-concurrency guidance recommends PostgreSQL

- **WHEN** an operator configures `codex-lb` for higher concurrency, sustained multi-worker traffic, or infrastructure-managed serving
- **THEN** official guidance recommends PostgreSQL via `CODEX_LB_DATABASE_URL`
- **AND** the guidance does not require changing unrelated listener or OAuth callback port defaults

### Requirement: Greenfield runtime baseline uses PostgreSQL for sustained multi-worker serving

The greenfield runtime baseline MUST use PostgreSQL through `CODEX_LB_DATABASE_URL` before recommending sustained multi-worker request serving. SQLite MUST remain supported for zero-config and simple local startup, but SQLite MUST NOT be presented as the preferred backend for new sustained deployments.

#### Scenario: Greenfield baseline selects PostgreSQL

- **WHEN** an operator follows the greenfield runtime baseline
- **THEN** the documented database backend is PostgreSQL via `CODEX_LB_DATABASE_URL`
- **AND** the guidance does not recommend increasing plain request workers on SQLite

#### Scenario: SQLite remains the local startup path

- **WHEN** an operator intentionally stays on SQLite
- **THEN** official guidance treats that as zero-config or local/smoke usage
- **AND** the guidance keeps the single-worker or equivalent write-serialized constraint separate from the greenfield baseline

### Requirement: Local and CI PostgreSQL surfaces track PostgreSQL 18

Local Compose and PostgreSQL-backed CI jobs MUST use PostgreSQL 18 for the
supported PostgreSQL coverage path. The local Compose PostgreSQL profile MUST
mount persistent data at the PostgreSQL 18 Docker image's supported parent data
directory and MUST preload `pg_stat_statements` when query-level runtime tuning
is part of the sustained deployment profile.

#### Scenario: Local Compose PostgreSQL uses PostgreSQL 18

- **WHEN** an operator renders or starts the local Compose PostgreSQL profile
- **THEN** the PostgreSQL service uses a PostgreSQL 18 image
- **AND** the named PostgreSQL data volume is mounted at `/var/lib/postgresql`
- **AND** the service starts PostgreSQL with `pg_stat_statements` preloaded

#### Scenario: PostgreSQL CI jobs use PostgreSQL 18

- **WHEN** CI runs PostgreSQL-backed tests or migration checks
- **THEN** the PostgreSQL service image uses PostgreSQL 18
