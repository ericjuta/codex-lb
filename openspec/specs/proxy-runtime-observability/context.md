# Proxy Runtime Observability Context

## Purpose and Scope

This capability defines what operators should be able to see while debugging proxy traffic: live server console logs, request-log summaries, and Prometheus metrics for sustained deployments.

See `openspec/specs/proxy-runtime-observability/spec.md` for normative requirements.

## Decisions

- **Timestamps are always on:** timestamped console logs are a baseline operator need, not a debug-only feature.
- **Request tracing is opt-in:** outbound request summary and payload tracing remain configurable because payload logs can be noisy or sensitive.
- **Error logs must be correlated:** request id, endpoint, status, code, and message are the minimum useful fields for debugging 4xx/5xx failures.
- **Metrics stay low-cardinality:** Prometheus labels may include bounded values such as route shape, status, transport, error class, bridge outcome, SQLite retry outcome, and service tier. They must not include prompts, bearer tokens, raw request ids, response ids, or auth headers.
- **Service-tier verification is observational:** codex-lb preserves the requested tier and records the upstream actual tier when upstream reports one. A mismatch is visible through request-log snapshots and the service-tier mismatch counter; it does not require changing the operator's tier preference.
- **Health and performance are separate reads:** a green container, readiness probe, and clean local error window prove the proxy is locally serving. They do not prove every request is fast, so slow-tail analysis starts with request-log percentiles, output-size/request-shape buckets, upstream failure classes, and requested-versus-actual service tier before changing local runtime settings.

## Operational Notes

- Use request ids to correlate inbound proxy logs, outbound upstream traces, and client-visible failures.
- Prefer summary tracing in normal debugging sessions; enable payload tracing only when the exact normalized outbound request matters.
- For direct compact `5xx` failures, look for `proxy_compact_failure` alongside `upstream_request_complete`; together they show the compact failure phase, failure detail, exception type, retry metadata, and affinity source.
- For the greenfield sustained baseline, enable `CODEX_LB_METRICS_ENABLED=true` and scrape the metrics port. The minimum alert bundle covers readiness, request success rate, p95 latency, upstream timeout or `stream_incomplete` spikes, SQLite lock pressure, bridge continuity errors, service-tier mismatches, and container restart/OOM signals.
- For service-tier verification, capture a snapshot with `scripts/codex_lb_live_snapshot.py` and inspect `request_logs.service_tier_counts` plus `request_logs.tier_mismatches`. The snapshot summarizes requested and actual tiers without printing prompts or auth headers.
- Treat health and latency as separate signals. A container can be running, restart-free, and answering `/health/ready` plus `/backend-api/codex/health` quickly while request logs still show slow-tail latency, upstream websocket open timeouts, or `stream_incomplete` errors. In that case the proxy is healthy enough to route traffic, but operators should investigate upstream service tier, prompt size, output size, websocket stability, and account/upstream behavior before calling the deployment fully healthy.
- When snapshots show requested `ultrafast` with actual upstream `default`, keep reporting it as a tier mismatch observation rather than a local proxy failure by itself. Correlate it with p95/max latency and recent error classes; do not hide it by changing the configured Codex CLI tier.
- For a quick live health/performance read, pair `scripts/codex_lb_live_snapshot.py` with the configured Codex CLI smoke (`codex exec --ephemeral ... "Reply with OK only."`). The snapshot shows local health, latency percentiles, upstream failure classes, and tier mismatches; the CLI smoke proves the configured provider chain without exposing credentials.

## Performance Triage Example

A gateway can be locally healthy while still showing a slow request tail. For example, a snapshot may show:

- container running with zero restarts and no OOM;
- `/health/ready` and `/backend-api/codex/health` returning `200`;
- no recent local ASGI exceptions, tracebacks, SQLite lock hits, or `TimeoutError` log patterns;
- request-log latency with healthy median traffic but elevated p90/p95;
- `requested_service_tier=ultrafast` while upstream reports `actual_service_tier=default`;
- `stream_incomplete` or `upstream_websocket_open_timeout` rows amid later successful websocket requests.

That combination should be reported as locally healthy with an upstream/request-shape latency caveat. The first follow-up is tier verification and request-shape/output-size analysis, not a local restart, proxy rewrite, or worker-count change.
